        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>A single array can store different types of data (string, boolean, etc.), typically that are related in some way.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1.</li>
          <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>Other conditional statements, such as "if", must be used to interrupt the control flow of a "for" loop.</li>
          <li>Functions create a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.</li>
          <li>Defining a funtion is not enough, a function must be called at the spot you want it to execute.</li>
