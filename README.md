# My Bootcamp Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a prework study guide for the full-stack bootcamp I'm about to begin.  I created this study guide per instructions, but also so I could begin to learn some of the skills I'll be developing during the bootcamp.  Throughout its creation, I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics, as well as how to operate a console, Visual Studio, and the basics of navigating GitHub.
